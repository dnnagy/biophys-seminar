abstract="We present a new approach to enlarging the basin of attraction of associative memory, including auto-associative memory and temporal associative memory. The memory trained by means of this method can tolerate and recover from seriously noisy patterns. Simulations show that this approach will greatly reduce the number of limit cycles.",
